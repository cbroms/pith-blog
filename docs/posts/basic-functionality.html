<h1>Functionality</h1>
<h2>Creating a new post</h2>
<p><img src="/images/basic.png"></p>
<p><a href="/posts/conversational-design">As we've previously discussed</a>, blocks are the most atomic elements in Pith. They're what every post is comprised of, and they're what's transcluded between posts. When creating a new post, the editor allows the user to create multiple blocks. The operation for creating a new block is a newline, and the operation for deleting one is hitting delete with the cursor at the beginning of the block. There are other operations available such as splitting a block's content in the center with a newline and creating two separate blocks. Here's what that process looks like:</p>
<p><img src="/images/basic-1.gif"></p>
<p>Once posted, posts appear in the discussion sequence, with the latest posts appearing at the bottom. We currently don't have any notion of a "user" other than the client's IP address, so the only information that is shown on a post is its content.</p>
<h2>Tagging blocks</h2>
<p>Each block can be tagged by anyone once it's posted. Here's what that looks like:</p>
<p><img src="/images/basic-2.gif"></p>
<p>These changes are reflected immediately across everyone's discussion views.</p>
<h2>Saving blocks</h2>
<p>Each block can be saved to a user's library. We're still exploring what this means; read more about this in <a href="/posts/considering-seraching">Considering Searching</a>.</p>
<h1>How it's built</h1>
<p>We're using React for the client and a python server for the backend. We're using <a href="http://socket.io">socket.io</a> to interface between the two. This allows for some very nice near-real time updates between clients—here are two separate clients side-by-side showing the immediate changes when a post is created or tag is added:</p>
<p><img src="/images/basic-3.gif"></p>
<p>The latest progress can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/rainflame/pith-client">client repository</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/rainflame/pith-api">server repository</a>.</p>
