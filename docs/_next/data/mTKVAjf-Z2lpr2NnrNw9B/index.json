Our main idea is the reflections of the large group are captured in a large, tree document. However, this presents several issues."},{"id":"popularity-metrics","title":"The Intuition to Avoid Popularity Metrics","date":"2020-12-29","author":"Christian Broms","summary":"One intuition that we've had since the start of the Pith project is that when designing the space, popularity metrics should be avoided. As the project has progressed we've found that a surprising number of common affordances in digital social spaces can be framed as popularity metrics. Plenty of these affordances can be both functional and delightful to use, which has forced the question of why we're really trying to avoid popularity metrics"},{"id":"0.0.1a-post-mortem","title":"Pith v0.0.1a Post Mortem","date":"2020-12-10","author":"Christian Broms","summary":"We tested the latest version of Pith today in a non-development context. To go along with this we've tagged the latest version of the code so we have a record of its state at each of these evaluation points. After each release we'll also be writing some kind of a post mortem to go over all the technical, design, and conceptual issues that arose."},{"id":"mid-fidelity","title":"Alpha prototype mid-fidelity mockups","date":"2020-09-27","author":"Christian Broms & Sydney Zheng","summary":"We'd like to share the latest medium fidelity mockups of our alpha prototype, which lays out the framework for a small group of people to have an organized discussion.

We've yet to discuss much about how we're building Pith, specifically the technologies we're using and architecture of the system."},{"id":"intro-presentation","title":"Pith Intro Presentation","date":"2020-08-26","author":"Christian Broms & Sydney Zheng","summary":"We recently put together a presentation that outlines the core goals for Pith, its general design, and the plan for building it."},{"id":"board-and-network","title":"The Board and Network","date":"2020-08-17","author":"Christian Broms & Sydney Zheng","summary":"Here we propose our current design for how Pith addresses organizing large-scale discussions to reach a decision effectively."},{"id":"clarifying-purpose","title":"Clarifying Pith's Purpose","date":"2020-08-09","author":"Sydney Zheng","summary":"We decided that Pith should be designed to solve the (more) specific problem of allowing large discussions to take place such that (1) every person's perspective is represented and (2) the discussion can eventually be condensed into a one-page summary that can then be used to review the main points or to make decisions."},{"id":"looking-forward","title":"Looking Forward","date":"2020-08-05","author":"Christian Broms","summary":"As Pith continues to develop, we're looking forward to what lies ahead in the design and development of the platform. There are a series of exciting phases that we've codified in three planned releases."},{"id":"summarization-design","title":"Summarization Design","date":"2020-07-27","author":"Christian Broms","summary":"In designing the summarization aspect to discussions, we've been faced with a plethora of options regarding both how the summary is created from existing blocks, and how it evolves as participants make edits."},{"id":"summarization-and-moderation","title":"Summarization and Moderation","date":"2020-07-20","author":"Sydney Zheng","summary":"The bulk of phase II is summarization. Phase 1 focused on how people interact through the familiar interface of chat. Through phase II, we will be building a space for them to develop an ongoing-summary of their conversation."},{"id":"outlining-phase-2","title":"Outlining Phase II of Prototyping","date":"2020-07-06","author":"Christian Broms","summary":"Having built a working prototype of the core chat functionality in Pith, we're moving on to the next phase of development in which we will address issues raised with the prototype so far and introduce summarization."},{"id":"testing-phase-1","title":"Feedback from Testing Phase I","date":"2020-06-28","author":"Sydney Zheng","summary":"We tested the prototype website chat with a group of people informally. We gave them some time to chat among themselves and explore the features organically. People were able to pick up how to use multiple blocks in a post and tags fairly quickly."},{"id":"transclusion","title":"Adding Transclusion","date":"2020-06-21","author":"Christian Broms","summary":"We've recently been working on adding a kind of hyperlinking functionality to the Pith prototype, called transclusion.

In a discussion, users can easily create posts which have smaller units of content called blocks."},{"id":"basic-functionality","title":"Adding Basic Functionality to the Test Object","date":"2020-06-14","author":"Christian Broms","summary":"We've begun to integrate some of the functionality from last week's post into the test object. At the moment the goal is to keep the development focused on getting the essential features roughly implemented, and then coming back later and adding a minimum amount of styling to increase the functionality of the prototype as an object to be evaluated by our testers."},{"id":"test-object","title":"Designing a First Test Object","date":"2020-06-07","author":"Christian Broms & Sydney Zheng","summary":"To begin to test out some of the features we've designed, we're creating a small protoype of the discussion interface. This test suite will serve as a way of evaluating the following design choices and features."},{"id":"conversational-design","title":"First Draft of Conversational Design","date":"2020-05-31","author":"Christian Broms & Sydney Zheng","summary":"We've outlined a few goals for the design of the conversation in addition to features that help address them.  The system should be online to allow an arbitrary number of people anywhere to converse with each other."},{"id":"representing-discussion","title":"Representing Discussion","date":"2020-05-24","author":"Sydney Zheng","summary":"How do we represent discussion in a way people can easily interact with?
